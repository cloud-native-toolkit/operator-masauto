## This checks unread notifications for a release of a repository.
## If a release is found for that repo, then an issue is opened in 
## a specified repository.  That notification is then marked as read
## so it isn't processed again.
##
## Requires: 
##   - an access token is required that has access to read notifications
##     and access to create an issue.
##   - the account the access token belongs to, must subscribe to notifications 
##     from the repository it is watching
## 

# repo string in format: "{org}/{repo}" 
REPO_NAME="$1" # repo to watch
ISSUE_REPO="$2" # repo to create issues in

# get the notifications for the repo
resp=$(curl -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ${NOTIFICATION_TOKEN} " \
https://api.github.com/notifications)

# for each notification check if it's a release notification for the repo we care about
for row in $(echo "${resp}" | jq -r '.[] | @base64'); do
    type=$(echo ${row} | base64 -d | jq -r '.subject.type' )
